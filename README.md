This is a simple set of instructions to add a second P25 reflector on the same x86 or VPS.  It assumes you are already operating a P25 Reflector and wish to add a second. You can copy the P25Reflector2.ini and P25Reflector2.sh or create your own.  Each reflector must have it's own UDP port; example 41000 for the first reflector and 41001 for the second. Set it in the P25Reflector.ini and open the port on your VPS or NAT router.  That's it.
